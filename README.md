## Adding SfComboBox reference
You can add SfComboBox reference using one of the following methods:

### Method 1: Adding SfComboBox reference from nuget.org

Syncfusion Xamarin components are available in nuget.org. To add SfComboBox to your project, open the NuGet package manager in Visual Studio, search for Syncfusion.Xamarin.SfComboBox, and then install it.

### Method 2: Adding SfComboBox reference from toolbox

Syncfusion also provides Xamarin Toolbox. Using this toolbox, you can drag the SfComboBox control to the XAML page. It will automatically install the required NuGet packages and add the namespace to the page. To install Syncfusion Xamarin Toolbox, refer to Toolbox.

### Method 3: Adding SfComboBox assemblies manually from the installed location

If you prefer to manually reference the assemblies instead referencing from NuGet, add the following assemblies in respective projects.

Location: {Installed location}/{version}/Xamarin/lib

## Initializing ComboBox
Import the SfComboBox namespace in respective page as shown in the following code.

**[XAML]**
```
xmlns:combobox="clr-namespace:Syncfusion.XForms.ComboBox;assembly=Syncfusion.SfComboBox.XForms"
```

**[C#]**
```
using Syncfusion.XForms.ComboBox;
```
Then initialize an empty combobox as shown in the following code,

**[XAML]**

```
<StackLayout VerticalOptions="Start" HorizontalOptions="Start" Padding="30">
	<combobox:SfComboBox HeightRequest="40" x:Name="comboBox"/>
</StackLayout>
```

**[C#]**

```
SfComboBox comboBox = new SfComboBox();
comboBox.HeightRequest = 40;
```
